# Morse-Code-Encoder-and-Decoder


A documentation of the design Process for my morse code encoder and decoder

## Limitations

Due to this project being a university course work project there are some limitations that I must follow.
1. The function "encodeWord" takes an ASCII character string and replaces it with "beep"s and "Silence"s
2. 1 Beep corrosponds to a short beep
3. 3 Beeps corresponds to a long beep
4. 1 Silence corresponds to a gap between beeps
5. 3 Silences corresponds to gaps between letters
6. 7 Silences corresponds to gaps between words
7. This must work with any encoding, not just the one given in the program.


## Task 1

Task one: Write the function "encodeWord" that given any table and any string, encodes the string according to the table
